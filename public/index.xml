      <description>I decided to read a bunch of &amp;ldquo;life advice&amp;rdquo; threads from hacker news which I summarized below:
Do regular blood tests / healthchecks Eat less Maintenaince is harder than building things up - cultivate a habit of exercising early since this will only become - harder Take good care of you teeth Some fun activities include lifting, cyclying, surf, dancing&amp;hellip; Do stretch / pick up yoga Fight the urge of becoming complacent - learn and try things personally and professionally Set strict workhours - stress will greatly impact you mental and pysical health, it is rarely worth it Have clear goals for yourself every month, year and decade Minimize distractions - it is hard to overstate how important this is an how bad most people are at it Conciously work to regret more things Get good sleep - at least 8 hours Find a good therapist Avoid attaching your identity to people, their idea of who you are, youre job, or you posessions Be a &amp;ldquo;bro&amp;rdquo; not a &amp;ldquo;bob&amp;rdquo; at work - get excited about things, don&amp;rsquo;t complain and do talk to the younger / newer people Do medidate Do exercise regularly - it will pay huge dividends later in life Remember that at 30 you can still drop everything and go hike the Appalachian trail, at 40 that might not be possible - nor sound appealing Love your boyfriend/girlfriend as much as you did when you where a teenager Be a doer, not a talker Wear earplugs at concerts Realize how much incentives matter - everything is driven by &amp;ldquo;personal incentives&amp;rdquo; more so that &amp;ldquo;business incentives&amp;rdquo; - and these two aren&amp;rsquo;t usually aligned Make the most out of your time with your parents Marry someone &amp;ldquo;above your station&amp;rdquo; emotionally Find the right set of people to surround yourself with and mantain these relationships Keep track of your friends (and their contact details) and reach out to them often Have parties Dress nicely, not to impress but to not look like a slob Pick one activity and commit to it for the next decade to get as good as you can Get a good mouse and keyboard Decide early whether you want kids </description>
