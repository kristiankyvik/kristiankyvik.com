<p>A collection of tips for people visiting Colombia. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Bogota</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Climb up to Montserrate and admire the gloomy landscape of this massive urban jungle.</li>
<li>City centre (La Candelaria): Discover where everything began at the capital of the old Nueva Granada Kingdom. During your walk go to Plaza Bolivar, Chorro de quevedo,  Museo del Oro and la Puerta Falsa for the best <em>ajiaco</em> in town.</li>
<li>Gold Museum: the <em>Museo del Oro</em> is one of its kind, admire all the gold pieces will help you to understand the legend of El Dorado as well the aboriginal prehispanic cultured such as the Muisca, Tayrona or Pijao.</li>
<li>Take a graffiti tour: its worth it due to all the artistic painting all around the city.</li>
<li>Zona G: neighbourhood where you will find English houses following the Tudor style in the Chapinero area.</li>
<li>Leo Cocina y Cava: A michelin restaurant from the best Latin American chef Leonor Espinoza.</li>
<li>Enjoy nightlife like a Rolo (<em>bogotano</em>): there is no place like Bogota to party like Andres Carne de Res (the one in Chia is better than the one in Bogotá centre).</li>
<li>Check out Theatrón (nightclub).</li>
<li>And also, for book lovers, Merlin is a must go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Near Bogota:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Catedral de Zipaquirá and the Paramos like the one in Sumapaz if you are into nature are worth it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eje Cafetera</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Valle del Cocora is a must in Colombia. Also nice to visit peculiar towns like Salento and Filandia. For good logistics I recommend to stay in La Tebaida area near Armenia.</li>
<li>Un tour en una finca tradicional cafetera. Yo estuve en la de Manolo. Hay cata de café y es súper interesante.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cartagena de Indias</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cartagena&rsquo;s old town: we call Cartagena the Pearl of the Caribbean for a reason and the main city center will help you to understand why. Being a romantic paradise that will help you feel if you are in &ldquo;Love of Times of Cholera from renown writer Garcia Marquez&rdquo;. Relax, take your time, (shoes and sunscreen) and start your walk. Inside the area there is many interesting spots like Catedral Santa Catalina, Torre del Reloj or  Museo de la Inquisición. I recommend some shopping at La Serrezuela or in some nice boutiques like Silvia Tcherassi for women.</li>
<li>Fortaleza San Felipe de Barajas: its a fortress famous for the battle called La Oreja de Jenkins between the English empire and Spanish one, architectural wise it is a gem in terms of strategy.</li>
<li>Be conscious about the city differences: being the most unequal city of the country it is interesting to find contrasts seeing both the fancy area Bocagrande and Castillogrande and shanty towns behind Cerro de la Popa. I Recommend go to the cerro with Taxi for a nice view of the city.</li>
<li>Manga and Getsemani: nice areas close to city center. Manga used to be the upscale and traditional area of Cartagena. Getsemani is really close to the city center (walking distance) and I recommend to stay there as well enjoy the area. For restaurants if you don&rsquo;t mind the cash go to <em>Club de Pesca</em> in Manga at night. It has the best view of the city as well as some delicious seafood.</li>
<li>Beaches: Bocagrande is not worth and Baru even though the water is blue and pristine there is too many vendors do don&rsquo;t recommend. What is worth it is Islas del Rosario where you can take a boat tour for a day</li>
<li>While in Cartagena I recommend to try special dishes from the caribbean  like <em>Arepa de huevo</em>, <em>pargo rojo</em> or <em>Cazuela de Mariscos</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>San Andrés</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>San Andres y Providencia: islands located in the Caribbean with a creole flavour. San Andres is the main one being a famous destination for Colombians. Enjoy Mar de los siete colores and Cañon de Morgan. Providencia is the smallest one but also the less touristic and most beautiful of the two. You can reach it with a small plane leaving from San Andrés.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Santa Marta</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Santa Marta if you want to stay not far from the city I recommend Bello Horizonte beach in a hotel like Marriot Playa Dormida.</li>
<li>Minca: natural area in Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Consider renting a small cabin here or looking into staying at an Ecohostal. There is a valley (eco-aldea) called Nuevo Mundo that is worth mentioning.</li>
<li>Tayrona: A sacred place for the indigenous tribe at La Sierra: the Koguis. It is one of Colombia most famous beaches as well landscape. Depending on the day and the wind I would not advise to swim due to the waves. To arrive you might have to take a ling walk or hire a donkey.</li>
<li>Palomino: worth a visit if going from Tayrona to la Guajira. There is a hostel called Costeño Beach (owned by the Bomba Stereo lead singer).</li>
<li>Ciudad Perdida: if you are into trekking going to the lost city or colombian Machu Pichu is a very cool experience. With a 4 day journey you will walk passing through indigenous and rural areas before finding the jungle and finally this lost city that was discovered few decades ago. With a cost of 300 euros it includes meal, transportation and accommodation. There is many agencies from Santa Marta running this trip.</li>
<li>Check out Tagagnga if you are into them hippy vibes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Barranquilla</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fourth city in terms of population and the capital of the <em>costeño</em> area of the country. It is not specially worth it only if you are going to the Carnival that is world class or to see where Shakira grew up in the north of the city.</li>
<li>Check out el malecón del río, La Troja (emblematic salsa spot) and lastly La Cueva (Gabriel García Marque&rsquo;s bar).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>La Guajira</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have time after Santa Marta La Guajira is a remote yet beautiful area home of the Wayuu Culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While in La Guajira you can go to Punta Gallinas for a nice Kite surf session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check out Palomino if you are into them hippy vibes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Medellin and surroundings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Medellin and Antioquia: a traditional yet prosperous region home of the Paisas. Also J Balvin&rsquo;s hometown.</li>
<li>Museo Antioquia: if you are into curves and art this is the place to check Botero. It is located in Plaza Botero.</li>
<li>Comuna 13: used to be a no-go place during the times of Pablo Escobar, now it has undergone such a massive cultural transformation that it worth paying a visit.</li>
<li>El Poblado and Parque Lleras: nice upscale area of the city with lot of bars to hang out and restaurants. Stay in sites Hotel for a nice pool with views of the city.</li>
<li>Pueblito Paisa: up in a small hill this <em>pueblito</em> imitates the typical towns of Antioquia and its idiosincracy with a strong Basque heritage</li>
<li>Parque de los Pies Descalzos: a nice park that shows the enormous transformation of the city and its no to violence and yes to open areas. You can reach with the metro.</li>
<li>If you are into Nature Cerro Nutibara and Jardin Botanico are worth a try.</li>
<li>Pablo Escobar Grave and the Narco Tour: if you were a Narcos fan you might be interested even though Colombians dislike this type of tourism. During the tour you can meet Osito, Pablo brother and former accountant of the Medellin Cartel.</li>
<li>Guatapé El Peñol: it is a rock in the peculiar town of Guatapé with very beautiful views.</li>
<li>Also some nice towns in Antioquia would be Jardin and Santa Fe de Antioquía.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amazonas</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You need to go to Leticia with place there you will find many different creatures and species as well as having the chance of crossing by foot both Peru and Brazil since they are all located in the Triángulo Amazónico.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Los Llanos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check out Caño Cristales y Villavicencio and enjoy a Joropó session and eat Ternera a la Llanera (delicious!).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cali</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take Salsa Classes: you can have cheap classes and attend many different bars like La Topa Tolondra.</li>
<li>Walk around the city center with spots like Iglesia la Hermita, San Antonio area or Plaza de San Francisco.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chocó</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This underdeveloped and rainy yet very biodiverse area is a trendy gem of the country. If you are into rainy beaches and surf this is your place. Check Bahia Solano for surfing as well for whale watching.</li>
<li>Chocó &amp; Nuquí, to watch whales and manglares.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Boyacá</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not far from Bogota (considering Latin American roads) it is a region hone of the battle of the independence agains the spaniards as well as being considered a place of traditions.</li>
<li>Villa de Leyva: probably one of the most beautiful towns in the country a white village perfect for quad excursions or horse back riding.</li>
<li>Small towns of Raquirá, Mongui for handcrafts and Laguna de Tota to have a good trout.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Santander</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A proud region next to Boyacá with sweet spots like San Gil, Barichará and Cañon del Chicamocha. If you are not afraid you might want to try the <em>hormigas culonas</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other (for hardcore adventurers)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Malpelo for diving with sharks.</li>
<li>Guainia: a hidden gem hard to find in the middle of nowhere. The highlight is Cerros de Mavecure.</li>
