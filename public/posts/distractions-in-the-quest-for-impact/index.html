<p>It is surprisingly easy to get distracted in the quest for impact. The beginners mindset one has the first weeks after starting a new role vanishes exceptionally quickly. It does not take very long before you you catch yourself optimising for the wrong thing. Or worst, not optimising for anything at all.</p>
<p>Some of the symptoms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decisions on what to prioritise are taken based on who in the organisation complaints the loudest</li>
<li>Teams worry more about having &ldquo;enough things to work on&rdquo; versus ensuring they are &ldquo;working on the right thing&rdquo;</li>
