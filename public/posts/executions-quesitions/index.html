<p>These kinds of questions typically require you to role play as the PM of a company. Your job here will be to ask questions about a specific scenario with the objective of understanding what might be going wrong. Although one can expect there to be a a right answer, the trick with these questions is to realise that having the right answer is not relevant to whether your response is good. What is more important is that you are able to break down the problem in an approach that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the things you should keep in mind are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explain your process (be explicit!)</li>
<li>Demonstrate a common thread throughout response</li>
<li>Practice slicing and isolating variables to diagnose what might be causing issues
<ul>
<li>e.g. let&rsquo;s focus on demographic like age or location</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
