<p>I decided to read a bunch of &ldquo;life advice&rdquo; threads from hacker news which I summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do regular blood tests / healthchecks</li>
<li>Eat less</li>
<li>Maintenaince is harder than building things up - cultivate a habit of exercising early since this will only become - harder</li>
<li>Take good care of you teeth</li>
<li>Some fun activities include lifting, cyclying, surf, dancing&hellip;</li>
<li>Do stretch / pick up yoga</li>
<li>Fight the urge of becoming complacent - learn and try things personally and professionally</li>
<li>Set strict workhours - stress will greatly impact you mental and pysical health, it is rarely worth it</li>
<li>Have clear goals for yourself every month, year and decade</li>
<li>Minimize distractions - it is hard to overstate how important this is an how bad most people are at it</li>
<li>Conciously work to regret more things</li>
<li>Get good sleep - at least 8 hours</li>
<li>Find a good therapist</li>
<li>Avoid attaching your identity to people, their idea of who you are, youre job, or you posessions</li>
<li>Be a &ldquo;bro&rdquo; not a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; at work - get excited about things, don&rsquo;t complain and do talk to the younger / newer people</li>
<li>Do medidate</li>
<li>Do exercise regularly - it will pay huge dividends later in life</li>
<li>Remember that at 30 you can still drop everything and go hike the Appalachian trail, at 40 that might not be possible - nor sound appealing</li>
<li>Love your boyfriend/girlfriend as much as you did when you where a teenager</li>
<li>Be a doer, not a talker</li>
<li>Wear earplugs at concerts</li>
<li>Realize how much incentives matter - everything is driven by &ldquo;personal incentives&rdquo; more so that &ldquo;business incentives&rdquo; - and these two aren&rsquo;t usually aligned</li>
<li>Make the most out of your time with your parents</li>
<li>Marry someone &ldquo;above your station&rdquo; emotionally</li>
<li>Find the right set of people to surround yourself with and mantain these relationships</li>
<li>Keep track of your friends (and their contact details) and reach out to them often</li>
<li>Have parties</li>
<li>Dress nicely, not to impress but to not look like a slob</li>
<li>Pick one activity and commit to it for the next decade to get as good as you can</li>
<li>Get a good mouse and keyboard</li>
<li>Decide early whether you want kids</li>
</ul>
