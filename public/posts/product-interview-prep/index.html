<p><em>NOTE: This is part of the series on PM interview prep</em></p>
<p>Practicing your product interview skills can not only prepare you for your next job hunt, but also help you sharpen your skills at your current role. I am working trough Exponent&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/pm">Complete PM Interview Course</a> and here are my notes.</p>
<h2 id="structuring-your-answer">Structuring your answer</h2>
<p>When answering any question, try to structure your answer using the template below.</p>
<p><strong>1 - Listen:</strong>
Take notes highlighting the main points</p>
<p><strong>2 - Questions:</strong>
Please restrain from answering question! Instead, aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope the question</li>
<li>Clarify any vague point by asking questions</li>
<li>Re-phrase the question (e.g. does this sound ok?)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3 - Pause:</strong>
Do not hesitate to spend at least 10-20 seconds before answering to think about the question</p>
<p><strong>4 - Structure:</strong>
As you pause, think about the structure. Invoke any frameworks (e.g. broad to deep). As an example, broad-to-deep lists possibilities and then picks one.</p>
<p><strong>5 - Give your answer:</strong>
Tell them what you think, give benchmarks and signposts, try to walk the interviewer through the answer.</p>
<p><strong>6 - Pivot and check-in:</strong>
Use the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Am I on the right track?</li>
<li>I decided not to touch a specific point. I could go into here, please let me know if I should go to more detail.</li>
<li>I realise that the direction I wanted to go is not the answer I want to continue for X and Y. Therefore I&rsquo;d like to take a moment to re-consider and think about a new direction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7 - Summary:</strong>
Summarise and add caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualitative tradeoffs - some pathological second order effects.</li>
<li>Second-hand effects&hellip;etc</li>
<li>Try to anticipate interviewer questions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pm-interview-dimensions">PM interview dimensions</h2>
<p>These are the dimensions companies often evaluate PMs on. I will be covering each of these topics in the next posts.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/posts/product-estimation-questions/">Estimation questions</a></li>
<li>Behavioural</li>
<li>Analytical</li>
<li>Execution</li>
<li>Product strategy</li>
<li>Product design</li>
<li>Technical</li>
</ul>
