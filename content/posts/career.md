- Role, as expected, heavily operational
- **Good**
	- Fun, steep learning curve, very fast feedback, fantastic functional team, get to work with GMs
	- Short term (6m)
		- Mastered e2e launch handbook
		- Learn more about the product growth disciplines (metrics driven, experiments)
		- Learn about fostering culture in teams to attract talent
		- Nail leading "bigger" product team (EM + designer)
- **Less good**
	- Smaloduct team, less strategic, no real long term product roadmap, a lot of gruff work.
- So far good outbalances the less good. Taking it as an MBA in product ops. 

- 5 years time
	- Maybe having a role closer to product leadership
	- I want to be better at crafting vision, and taking bigger bets backed by a strong product sense
	- Mentor and management skills could be interesting
