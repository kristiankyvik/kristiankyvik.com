# Ownership
- One OKR has 1 DRI (Directly Responsible Individual)
- Being a DRI means you're ultimately accountable for the OKR. It does not mean you execute all the work. DRI's often delegate and work across functions to get things done.
	- Tip: if you're dependent on another team to achieve your OKRs, understand that teams OKRs and align ahead of the cycle
- The DRI is free to take decisions on every topic and at the same time should not be burdened with having to provide detailed explanations for them.
- A team owns the OKR together.
- A DRI monitors and reports the OKR weekly
- OKRs are one important input, but not the whole input, for performance review. For example, OKR doesn't directly measure communication quality and XFN (cross function management).
# Definition & Measurement
- Objectives: where do I want to go?
	Objectives are a qualitative, aspirational and far reaching statement of what you are trying to achieve. These are not tasks or granular outcomes. 
	- Example: "Becomes the go-to for solar residential in Europe"
- Key results (KRs): how do I pace myself to see if I'm getting there? Key results have to be measurable outcomes that indicate you've achieved your objective. For each objective, things about the results you would like to see (and can measure) if you reached it. KRs are easy to measure (0-100%). Drive about 3 KRs per objective. 
	- Example: "50% battery attachment for mature markets"
- Individual OKRs (if necessary) roll up to team OKRs. Team OKRs roll up to company OKRs. Individuals and teams can drive additional OKRs that are relevant for them.
- OKRs are not a to-do list. For example presenting a product roadmap is not an OKR. It is part of the our process to build products that drive OKRs. 
# Process
- OKRs are publicly posted for the whole company
- Report one OKRs using red/yellow/green to represent confidence of completion.
	- Green: On trial, high likelihood of achieving goal
	- Yellow: Progressing but slower than expected; risk of not achieving goal.
	- Red: Needs attention, unlikely to achieve goal.
	- An OKR should go yellow before going green.
	- Red is good! Helps us identify blockers, solve them and and move forward.
	- For each of your OKRs, what one actions can you take to advance toward each of them?
	- For all OKRs that are far off-track, DRI creates a written Issue/Solution to get back on track.
- Translate OKRs into day to day work by following a pyramid of clarity. 
- You can change OKRs mid-cycle. A change could be justified with: 
	- Business pivots, e.g. entering a new market
	- New learnings, e.g. ran into an implementation roadblock
	- Resource change, e.g. new marketer allows un to run additional ad campaigns.
