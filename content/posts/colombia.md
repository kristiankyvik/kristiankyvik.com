**Bogota**

- Climb up to Montserrate and admire the gloomy landscape of a massive city.

- City center (La Candelaria): Discover where everything began at the capital of the old Nueva Granada Kingdom. During your walk go to Plaza Bolivar, Chorro de quevedo,  Museo del Oro and la Puerta Falsa for the best *ajiaco* in town.

- Gold Museum: the *Museo del Oro* is one of its kind, admire all the gold pieces will help you to understand the legend of El Dorado as well the aboriginal prehispanic cultured such as the Muisca, Tayrona or Pijao.

- Take a graffity tour: its worth it due to all the artistic painting all around the city

- Enjoy nightlife like a Rolo (*bogotano*): there is no place like Bogota to party like Andres Carne de Res (the one in Chia is better than the one in Bogotá centre).

**Near Bogota:**

- Catedral de Zipaquirá and the Paramos like the one in Sumapaz if you are into nature are worth it.

**Zona Cafetera**

- Valle del Cocora is a must in Colombia. Also nice to visit peculiar towns like Salento and Filandia. For good logistics I recommend to stay in La Tebaida area near Armenia.

**Cartagena de Indias**

- Cartagena's old town: we call Cartagena the Pearl of the Caribbean for a reason and the main city center will help you to understand why. Being a romantic paradise that will help you feel if you are in "Love of Times of Cholera from renown writer Garcia Marquez". Relax, take your time, (shoes and sunscreen) and start your walk. Inside the area there is many interesting spots like Catedral Santa Catalina, Torre del Reloj or  Museo de la Inquisición. I recommend some shopping at La Serrezuela or in some nice boutiques like Silvia Tcherassi for women. 

- Fortaleza San Felipe de Barajas: its a fortress famous for the battle called La Oreja de Jenkins between the English empire and Spanish one, architectural wise it is a gem in terms of strategy.

- Be conscious about the city differences: being the most unequal city of the country it is interesting to find contrasts seeing both the fancy area Bocagrande and Castillogrande and shanty towns behind Cerro de la Popa. I Recommend go to the cerro with Taxi for a nice view of the city.

- Manga and Getsemani: nice areas close to city center. Manga used to be the upscale and traditional area of Cartagena. Getsemani is really close to the city center (walking distance) and I recommend to stay there as well enjoy the area. For restaurants if you don't mind the cash go to *Club de Pesca* in Manga at night. It has the best view of the city as well as some delicious seafood.

- Beaches: Bocagrande is not worth and Baru even though the water is blue and pristine there is too many vendors do don't recommend. What is worth it is Islas del Rosario where you can take a boat tour for a day

- While in Cartagena I recommend to try special dishes from the caribbean  like *Arepa de huevo*, *pargo rojo* or *Cazuela de Mariscos*.

**Santa Marta**

- Minca: natural area in Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta

- Tayrona Park

**Barranquilla**: 

- The fourth city in terms of population and the capital of the *costeño* area of the country. It is not specially worth it only if you are going to the Carnival that is world class or to see where Shakira grew up in the north of the city.

**La Guajira**

-  If you have time after Santa Marta La Guajira is a remote yet beautiful area home of the Wayuu Culture.
-  While in La Guajira you can go to Punta Gallinas for a nice Kite surf session.

**Medellin and surroundings**

- Medellin and Antioquia: a traditional yet prosperous region home of the Paisas. Also J Balvin's hometown.

- Museo Antioquia: if you are into curves and art this is the place to check Botero. It is located in Plaza Botero.

- Comuna 13: used to be a no-go place during the times of Pablo Escobar, now it has undergone such a massive cultural transformation that it worth paying a visit.

- El Poblado and Parque Lleras: nice upscale area of the city with lot of bars to hang out and restaurants. Stay in sites Hotel for a nice pool with views of the city.

- Pueblito Paisa: up in a small hill this *pueblito* imitates the typical towns of Antioquia and its idiosincracy with a strong Basque heritage

- Parque de los Pies Descalzos: a nice park that shows the enormous transformation of the city and its no to violence and yes to open areas. You can reach with the metro.

- If you are into Nature Cerro Nutibara and Jardin Botanico are worth a try.

**Amazonas**

- Villa Vicencio: the city you will most likely visit if you want to go to the Amazonas.

**Los Llanos**

- Check out Villa Vicencio and visit Caño de Crystals.

**Cali**

- Visit if salsa is your thing.

**Boyacá**

- Region close to Bogotá. Visit Villa de Leyva and Paipa.

**Santander**

- Visit Barichara.
