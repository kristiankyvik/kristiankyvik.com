# Estimation questions
## How to answer them
**Memorise basic facts**
Create an [[estimations]] cheat sheet with useful reference numbers and baselines in relevant areas. Keep in mind that it is not about memorising the number themselves but more about being able to demonstrate your thinking.

**Scope the problem**
Ask clarification questions that will help you scope the problem.

**Break down the problem**
Make sure you share with your interviewer the structure you will use before getting to the answer. The focus here should be breaking down the problem in to more tractable components.

**Estimate**
Assuming you have both scoped the problem and also broken it down, you can now try to present you answer. It's important to note that the interviewer will not care about the exact answer, its about working through the answer justifying your process.

**Final answer**
After estimating the individual components, you can now provide a final estimate.

**Tell interviewer why you are wrong**
Do not stop after providing the final answer, but rather explain why the answer seems too low/high based on a gut check. Also explain what you would have done if you had had more time.

## Tips and strategies
### Estimating the unknowns
**Estimate via proxy**
If you struggle to come up with an estimate for something, try find a related metric you can estimate. For example, the number of dogs might be related to the number of households in a city.

**Personal references**
You can leverage personal experience to come up with estimations. For example, you might now that approx 50% of you friends have pets. You might also assume that approximately 50% of the city is in you age group (and that the remaining 50% has less or more dogs). Using these building block you can contruct an estimate.

**Upper and lower bounds**
When in doubt, try to find the upper and lower bound for the estimate. For example, the number of pets in a city is probably at most equal to the population and at least 1. Based on that you can take the average of the boundaries and then 50% of that to get to the number of dogs (the other half being cats). This is not perfect, but will often give you something good enough.

### Math tricks
**Rounding numbers**
The trick here is to round up. Just remember to state this clearly to the interviewer so that they can follow.

**Split multiplications**
How would you calculate 80K * 40 million. This could make it easier to calculate: `8*4*10*10*1000000 = 3.2 billion`

### Refining your answer
**Gut check**
If aft providing an answer you gut feel tells you it might be off, feel free to go back to the components and analyse where you probably over or under counted.

## Have a fact sheet

## Rubric for estimation questions
**Problem solving**
Asked insightful questions; set up an easy calculation and an accurate answer.

**Comfort with numbers**
Above-average "ease" in using numbers to an advantage; creative use of approximation, "rules of thumb", etc.

**Ability to identify possible errors**
Possible errors covered thoroughly, alternatives were offered, pros / cons were neatly summarised.

**Communication**
Clear, proactive communication; anticipated questions, articulated reasons for decision, "checked-in" throughout.

**Collaboration**
Took the lead and made exceptional use of the interviewer, discussion was more collaboration than interview.

**Creativity**
Exceptionally creativity and "out of the box" thinking on display; logic maintained, novel solutions found.
