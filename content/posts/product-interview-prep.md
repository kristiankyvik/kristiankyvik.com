Practicing your product interview skills can not only prepare you for your next job hunt, but also help you sharpen your skills at your current role. I am working trough Exponent's [Complete PM Interview Course](https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/pm) and here are my notes.

## Structuring your answer
When answering any question, try to structure your answer using the template below.
#### 1 - Listen
Take notes highlighting the main points
#### 2 - Questions
Please restrain from answering question! Instead, aim to:
- Scope the question
- Clarify any vague point by asking questions
- Re-phrase the question (e.g. does this sound ok?)
#### 3 - Pause
Do not hesitate to spend at least 10-20 seconds before answering to think about the question
#### 4 - Structure
As you pause, think about the structure. Invoke any frameworks (e.g. broad to deep). As an example, broad-to-deep lists possibilities and then picks one. 
#### 5 - Give your answer: 
Tell them what you think, give benchmarks and signposts, try to walk the interviewer through the answer.
#### 6 - Pivot and check-in: 
Use the following questions: 
- Am I on the right track?
- I decided not to touch a specific point. I could go into here, please let me know if I should go to more detail. 
- I realise that the direction I wanted to go is not the answer I want to continue for X and Y. Therefore I'd like to take a moment to re-consider and think about a new direction.
#### 7 - Summary: 
Summarise and add caveats:
- Qualitative tradeoffs - some pathological second order effects.
- Second-hand effects...etc 
- Try to anticipate interviewer questions.
