The following is an attempt to outline how one can live a more intentional life that minimises mimetic though and fosters a genuine curiosity to find opportunities to improve our world.
**Prioritise deepness**

Having a deep life means having the willingness to think about things deeply. There are two types of hard: (1) math hard, which is something hard to come up but easy to achieve once the solution is known and (2) bodybuilding hard, which is difficult to attain but everybody knows how to get there. The most incredible achievements in life or of the bodybuilding type. This is partly because these are long journeys with high drop-off rates that require a high level of persistence. 

A deep life requires:

*Building resilience*
Resilience is required to do what you think in absence of approval.
	- Build a toolkit to overcome procrastination and distraction
	- Focus on setting systems before goals, but do paint an ideal end state and work backwards towards that

*Building consistency*
- Focus on building consistency, those that are best at what they do are the ones that stuck with it the longest.
	- This can be done by getting really good at habit building
	- Commit to a minimal number of iterations, phrase as experiments with a defined date of revision

**Encourage Openness** 
For some, you might also have to battle a set of tendencies, including a proclivity one might have towards being close-minded and avoidant of new experiences

It is very common to to sit down and theorise about things within the safety of your your own privacy (*thoughboism*).

- Cultivate a bias for action to ensure you collect real-world feedback and insights
- Keep a steep learning gradient that ensures you defeat path dependency by introducing a variance of attempts
	- Learn with intent, when you read you should read with a goal of revising a running hypothesis

**Outtakes**
- its takes little to loose respect for your time, and to spend valuable time doing things half-
- Building a system, networking…etc above everything else
- When networking you should have soemthing to offer so to speak
- But how do you balance both end in mindness and system, to avoid getting trapped?
	- get out tgere
- Career capital lever
- Every days mall progeess and not forgetting what that main goal is
- Be slightly evil
- Product manager involves getting deep
