I recently decided to read a bunch of "advice" threads from hacker news. Here is a summary of what I found:

- Do regular blood tests / healthchecks
- Eat less
- Maintenaince is harder than building things up - cultivate a habit of exercising early since this will only become - harder
- Take good care of you teeth
- Some fun activities include lifting, cyclying, surf, dancing...
- Do stretch / pick up yoga
- Fight the urge of becoming complacent - learn and try things personally and professionally
- Set strict workhours - stress will greatly impact you mental and pysical health, it is rarely worth it
- Have clear goals for yourself every month, year and decade
- Minimize distractions - it is hard to overstate how important this is an how bad most people are at it
- Conciously work to regret more things
- Get good sleep - at least 8 hours
- Find a good therapist
- Avoid attaching your identity to people, their idea of who you are, youre job, or you posessions
- Be a "bro" not a "bob" at work - get excited about things, don't complain and do talk to the younger / newer people
- Do medidate
- Do exercise regularly - it will pay huge dividends later in life
- Remember that at 30 you can still drop everything and go hike the Appalachian trail, at 40 that might not be possible - nor sound appealing
- Love your boyfriend/girlfriend as much as you did when you where a teenager
- Be a doer, not a talker
- Wear earplugs at concerts
- Realize how much incentives matter - everything is driven by "personal incentives" more so that "business incentives" - and these two aren't usually aligned
- Make the most out of your time with your parents
- Marry someone "above your station" emotionally
- Find the right set of people to surround yourself with and mantain these relationships
- Keep track of your friends (and their contact details) and reach out to them often
- Have parties
- Dress nicely, not to impress but to not look like a slob
- Pick one activity and commit to it for the next decade to get as good as you can
- Get a good mouse and keyboard
- Decide early whether you want kids
