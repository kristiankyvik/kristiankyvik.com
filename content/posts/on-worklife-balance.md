- No work on Sundays. Use your Monday as a thinking & planning day instead.
- Strive to plan activities and personal projects after work (evenings & weekends) 
- Be slightly evil - always consider “what is in it for me?”
- Remember that you are paid to work 8 hours. No more. Instead of working longer, work smarter. 
- Be picky about what you spend your time on. Think about levers when choosing what to focus on.
- Have one or more goals / projects you look forwards that are not work related.
- Set up your phone / devices in a a way that reinforces the above
- Think of yourself as a contractor and you employer as a one of your (many) clients. Do not optimize for a client alone, that is risky and not a good strategy
- Be strategic about your energy. Your cognitive stamina is finite, don’t let your day job use up all your juice.
