- Replace stress eating with other activity e.g. making mint tea or 10x push-ups
- Do intermittent fasting: skip breakfast, have a snack midday and then eat dinner at 17-18:00
- Doing exercise (especially cardio) can decrease appetite
- Consider dropping alcohol in most social events. Do the same with sugar.
- Be smart when eating out. Switch mindset to paying for caloric dishes to paying for healthy yet delicious alternatives.
- Give time for the food to settle in. Takes some minutes for satiation to kick in.
- Avoid mindset of food being linked to pleasure. Think of food more like fuel.
- Reflect about how different todays world is compared to the one our ancestral environment. Scarcity is no longer the rule, but the opposite is true. 
- Consider how you feel after one or more situations where you over eat. Not good.
- “One minute in the lips, forever in the hips” and 
- Think about the overlap about the foods you like and the ones that are healthy. Eat those.
- Become a person that does not eat trash, because it is smart (think of it as a snack)
